# exportMoveSuunto
Export in the choosen annual list under movescount (like http://www.movescount.com/moves/move129911103#navigation=table&calendar-month=2019-08&table-sort=activityID&table-order=-1&table-page=12) the file xlsx for Swimming move

It's a simple javascript.
I use it under Firefox Scratchpad to download moves from Suunto Movescount.
The code is ready to use for swimming moves in xlsx format, but it could be use for all other types in all other format as KML, GPX, FIT and TCX.
